## Business Model

Teevent operates as an outsourced business. We outsource production to suppliers in China, who ship the products to Malaysia. Once the goods arrive, we handle quality checks and assessments before shipping them to our customers.

This outsourcing arrangement allows us to keep costs low, but it is not something we disclose to customers. From their perspective, we are the direct provider.

## Unique Selling Points

### Competitive Pricing
- Our products are priced to be student-friendly and affordable.
- Market research (done by requesting quotations from local suppliers) shows that our prices, especially for lanyards, are lower than most suppliers in Malaysia.
- Although occasionally customers may find lower quotations elsewhere, this is not frequent. Overall, our prices for lanyards and customized t-shirts remain highly competitive.

### Superior Customer Service
- Through market research, we noticed a common problem: most Malaysian suppliers reply very slowly, some do not reply at all, and their overall service is poor despite charging high prices.
- Teevent differentiates itself by being responsive, attentive, and reliable — qualities that are especially important for student organizers and businesses running time-sensitive events.

### Design Flexibility (Accepting Canva)
- Many suppliers in Malaysia only accept design files in Adobe formats such as Illustrator or Photoshop, which are difficult for the average student organizer to use.
- At Teevent, we also accept Canva designs — a popular and easy-to-use design platform. We then convert Canva files into the necessary Adobe formats.
- This lowers the barrier for customers and makes the ordering process much easier, especially for students who are not trained in design software.

### Lean Cost Structure
- We have no office, minimal staff, and low overheads.
- Our main cost is the cost of goods, allowing us to pass savings directly to customers.

### Quality Assurance
- Even with outsourcing, we ensure proper quality checks in Malaysia before delivery to customers.

## Current Focus

For now, our focus remains on custom merchandise, particularly:

- **Custom t-shirts**
- **Custom lanyards**
- **Custom canvas bags**
- **Custom tote bags**
- **Custom acrylic keychains**
- **Custom pin & button badges**

These are our strongest products because:
- We have reliable suppliers.
- Our quality is strong for the price.
- Our prices are extremely competitive in the market.
- Our ordering process is more customer-friendly compared to traditional suppliers.

## Future Vision

Looking ahead, Teevent plans to develop a centralized platform that connects event organizers with suppliers in Malaysia.

### The Problem
- Finding local suppliers is currently inefficient.
- We rely on searching through Google Maps, Google Search, or social media, which is time-consuming.
- Many Malaysian suppliers are still traditional businesses with weak online presence.
- Their responsiveness and customer service are poor, further slowing down the process.

### The Opportunity
- Existing platforms like Shopee are primarily B2C and focus on non-customized products.
- There is a gap in the market for a B2B platform tailored to event organizers and suppliers.

### The Solution
Teevent envisions building a centralized platform (similar to Grab, but for event supply needs) that directly connects event organizers with suppliers.

This would save time, improve efficiency, and create new business opportunities.

#### Fade-In Animations
```css
.fade-in {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(30px);
    transition: opacity var(--transition-slower) cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.610, 0.355, 1), 
                transform var(--transition-slower) cubic-bezier(0.215, 0.610, 0.355, 1);
}

.fade-in.visible {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
}
